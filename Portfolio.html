<h2><strong>EXPERIENCE</strong></h2>
<p>
I know there is a long way to go from taking a Front-End Web Development class to building a Robot. But I guess my master thinks she is going to hire someone to help her make me. Either way, Robanesh is <strong>Awesome</strong> and a concept to be built out, and perhaps I'll change all of this to Alexis' very own porftolio but for the sake of turning this in. This is what I got.
